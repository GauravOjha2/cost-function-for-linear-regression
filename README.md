# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression Cost Function & Model Output

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **univariate linear regression** using NumPy, including:

- Computing the model output \( f(x) = wx + b \)
- Calculating the cost function (Mean Squared Error)
- Visualizing predictions (optional)

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) Pandas

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Linear Regression Model
- Model Prediction
- Cost Function Computation
- Mean Squared Error
- Vectorized Operations (optional improvements)

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-cost.git
   cd linear-regression-cost
````

2. Make sure you have the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
   ```

3. Run the Python file:

   ```bash
   python linear_model.py
   ```

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

* `linear_model.py`: Main script with model output and cost function.
* `README.md`: Project description.
* (Optional) `requirements.txt`: Add if you're packaging the project.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Output

```python
total cost is : 101385.0
```

This output represents the cost (error) of the model with the chosen parameters.

---

## âœ… To Do

* [ ] Add gradient descent for training
* [ ] Plot cost function vs. parameters
* [ ] Visualize predictions using Matplotlib
